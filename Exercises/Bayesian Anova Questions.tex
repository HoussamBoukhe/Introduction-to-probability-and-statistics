\textit{A Tutorial on Conducting and Interpreting a Bayesian ANOVA in JASP, Van den Bergh et al., 2020.} \\


\begin{enumerate}
    \item What does ANOVA stand for? In which cases do we apply this method? Discuss one-way and two-way ANOVA, MANOVA, and repeated/mixed ANOVA.
    
    \item On page 75, what do the authors mean by \textit{binary thinking}?
    
    %\item Design a computer experiment to illustrate the idea of risk of first kind error and the power of a test, in the case of a one-sample $t$-test.
    
    \item Explain what is meant by \textbf{knowledge update} in Bayesian inference.
    
    \item In Bayesian ANOVA, what are the null and alternative models?
    
    \item What is the Bayes factor for two models $M_1$ and $M_2$? How to interpret $BF_{12} = 5$?
    
    \item Discuss the differences between Frequentist and Bayesian approaches.
    
    \item Comment on the following sentence: "Bayesian ANOVA contrasts the predictive performance of competing models.''
    
    \item What are the assumptions for ANOVA models? How can you verify they are satisfied?
    
    \item What is transitivity from a mathematical/logic point of view? Using transitivity, compute $BF_{02}$ knowing that $BF_{01} = a$ and $BF_{12} = b$.
    
    \item How are model-averaged effects obtained?
    
    \item Discuss the principle of marginality.
    
    \item Explain the error percentage given in JASP outputs.
    
    \item Outline the main steps involved in conducting an ANOVA.

	\item Give a brief description of the \texttt{ToothGrowth} dataset.
    
    \item Import this data in JASP, then perform a Bayesian two-way ANOVA, and comment on the output.
    
    \item Discuss the different possible prior specifications available in JASP and perform a robustness check.
\end{enumerate}
